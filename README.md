# optimize_direct_marketing_campaign

To assess and improve the cost-effectiveness of their direct marketing campaigns, a charitable organization desires a machine learning model to assist in predicting overall expected gift amounts from donors. A properly designed classification model could predict response rates, minimize excessive mailings, and appropriately target potential donors, thus maximizing the organizationâ€™s profit from the marketing campaign. Leveraging recent mailing records, this organization compiled (3984) observations of (20) variables that relate to determining whether an individual will donate to their cause and, if so, the dollar amount of said donation.

This paper utilizes the provided charity dataset to create a two-stage approach for profit maximization. First, focus on classifying candidates based on whether they respond, or donate. It is desired to exceed the recent mailing records response rate of 10%. Second, create a prediction model that identifies the expected gift amounts from donors, based on the donor-classified observations only. It is desired to meet or exceed the recent mailing records average donation of $14.50. However, the desired end state is to maximize the expected profit from the entire mailing campaign. Each mailing costs $2.00 to send and, using the average donation amount and response rate identified above, the most recent campaign netted the charity organization -$0.55 per mailing. Overall, the resultant models should increase the net profit for each mailing.
Through the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), multiple variable transformations were considered and implemented in determining the expected donation amount from donors. Additionally, the EDA considered the relevancy of each variable to donor classification and donation prediction.

Following EDA, the first step of a two-stage approach is explored. Various models, to include gradient boosted tree, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors, generalized linear model (logistic regression), classification tree, bagging, random forest, ensemble stacking, and least squares regression were examined and compared to determine the best possible model for binary prediction of whether an observation classifies as a donor or not. The objective of this classification building is to maximize the gross profit that our model achieves on the validation data set. The gross profit is the maximum in a cumulative sum of the ordered donation probability times the average donation amount of $14.50 minus $2.00 of mailing cost.

The second step, a predictive model for the donation amount of classified donors, is explored. Several model types and transformations were leveraged in the process, namely the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), best subset selection techniques for OLS, ridge regression, lasso regression, principal component regression, partial least squares, gradient boosted trees, generalized linear models, random forests, K-nearest neighbors, several types of discriminant analyses and other tree based methods.

This paper concludes with the selection of the single best model in each step, though alternative candidates that performed slightly worse are also discussed. Those best two models, one for classification and one for regression, predict the donation probability and the donation amount found in the .csv file that accompanies this disquisition. Additional estimations are also made, like the average amount of money spent in the training, validation, and the test data sets.
